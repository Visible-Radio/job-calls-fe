IBEW Job Calls Database
I built the front end of my fullstack Job Calls application in React with Chart.js. It displays data relevant to the various classifications of members represented by the union about available jobs, and also serves as an index into the state of the construction sector in the Toronto area. Users can search by date, worker classification and company. Returned results can be filtered further by keywords.

Both the API and the font end are hosted on Heroku.  The free tier of Heroku Postgres is a little sluggish.  I may upgrade it to a standard package in the future.
